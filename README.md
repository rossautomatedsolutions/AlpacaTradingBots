Alpaca Trading Bots Using Python

A few example trading bots are here for inspiration. 
* Basic Trading Bot: Buys at set intervals and then liquidates. This is entirely based on times
* Subscriptions: Examples of streaming data via webockets
* RSI: Trades an RSI strategy based on 1H data from Yahoo Finance
* Bollinger Bands: Trades a Bollinger Bands strategy based on websocket data. 2 implementations are provided: 1 using TA-Lib & 1 not using that library/coding ourself. This includes an example of logging
* Multi Strategy Framework: Demonstrates how to implemente a multi strategy approach of the above bots 

Each example stands alone, but a good exercise would be to combine them all so that any strategy could be used on any asset

None of this is financial advice.
